                            Iâ€™m a {age} year old software developer with a passion for math,
                            science and understanding how the world works. In my free time you'll
                            probably find me playing guitar, learning about chess, or lifting
                            weights in the gym.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            I am motivated in life by making progress; whether
                            that be in my career, in my hobbies, in my relationships or in the world,
                            I am always looking for ways to do things better. I love analysing things,
                            sometimes beyond what is necessary and enjoy the process of gaining a deep
                            understanding of how things work. I try my best to get many perspectives on
                            ideas and think it is important to be exposed to differing opinions to
                            refine ideas
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Progress iterations, learning / understanding, discussion / perspectives no
                            matter from who, always a way to do things better; you can never be too efficient,
                            just optimising for the wrong variables, important to put your foot down when you
                            know your right; there could be lots of other people quietly thinking the same thing, comfort
